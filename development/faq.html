<p>
    When is a D-Ostomy most useful?

</p>

<p>
    The D-Ostomy is most helpful when there is anatomy (bellybutton, incision, scar, rolls, folds, second ostomy, drains, etc)
    that make it hard for a normal appliance to land without overlap.
    The straight edge side of the D-ostomy can be placed next to these
    challenging areas, allowing the appliance to seal without involving the
    anatomy that may have caused issues in the past.</p>

<p>
