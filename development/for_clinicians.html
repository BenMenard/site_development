<p>D-Ostomy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ever been frustrated by a circular ostomy appliance that overlaps a fresh surgical incision? We know we have. The incision may weep a little, which causes the ostomy adhesive to loosen and eventually lift. This lifting allows liquid stool to sneak where it was never meant to be, onto the wound itself. Before you know it, you are dealing with ostomy leakage and sometimes worse, a wound infection. This only makes the problem worse, as now the wound must be opened to battle the infection. There is now wet to dry dressing or a VAC dressing within the landing field of your ostomy appliance. At least in the case of the VAC, there is plastic to land the appliance on… until the VAC starts sucking stool from beneath the appliance into the wound. It feels like there is no way to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After years of feeling frustrated with this particular scenario, our team invented the D-Ostomy. &nbsp;Our novel, D-shaped ostomy, is designed to avoid appliance overlap from the very beginning. The straight edge can be placed against the incision, rather than over it, avoiding overlap and the issues that come with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since its inception, the D-Ostomy has generated a lot of enthusiasm for numerous other scenarios. As we took this ostomy appliance to conferences and discussed it with expert wound care nurses across the country,<strong> </strong><strong>it became clear that there were so many more great uses for the D-Ostomy beyond a fresh midline incision.</strong></p>

<p><strong>D-Ostomy can be a solution</strong><strong> for Incisions, open wounds requiring packing, use near a VAc, scars, skinfolds or rolls, second ostomy, adjacent drains, nearby umbilicus, wheelchair-bound patients for whom the edge of their current appliance rubs on the thigh.</strong></p>

<p>Every body is different. One person may need the straight edge at the top, while someone at the bottom. Someone else may need the straight edge to the right or the left. We get it. For this reason, our pouches come in all directions. You place the straight edge however you need that, and don’t worry if it turns our D into a U, or some other shape. Our drainable and closed pouches each come in four different directions so that we have whatever you and your patient need.&nbsp;</p>
